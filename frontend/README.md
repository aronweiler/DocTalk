# AI Chat Bot

## Technologies Used
- DocTalk API - For communicating with the AI
- Celery - Getting the response from an AI API is going to take a while. So Celery will be used to perform this task in the background.
- WebSockets using Django Channels - To send the client the response generated by the AI immediately when itâ€™s available.
- Redis - Will be used as a message broker and result backend for Celery. In addition, it will be used as a channel layer for WebSocket communication.
- TailwindCSS - To create the user interface.
