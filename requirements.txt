# torch
# To install torch for GPU (CUDA 12.1), use the following command:
# pip3 install --force-reinstall --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu121
# ^^ The force reinstall is needed because the version of torch that gets installed as a dependency in other places is not correct
# NOTE: The pip install of ffmpeg-python is broken, so you need to install ffmpeg manually
