Subject: Vulnerability allowing modification of a drug library

Description
On 7/9/2023, during routine system monitoring, I came across a critical vulnerability in the drug library of our medical device system. This incident report aims to provide a plain English description of the scenario in which the vulnerability occurred.

Scenario
Our medical device, which helps healthcare professionals manage patient medications, experienced a vulnerability that allowed unauthorized individuals to modify the drug library. The drug library contains vital information about medications, including dosages, interactions, and safety guidelines. Due to the vulnerability, an attacker with access to the device over the Internet could make unauthorized changes to this essential database.

In this scenario, imagine a situation where our medical device accidentally became accessible over the Internet without proper security measures in place. This exposure created an opportunity for malicious actors to exploit the vulnerability without needing any special permissions or interaction from users. The vulnerable device remained unchanged, maintaining its original purpose and functionality.

The impact of this vulnerability on the device was significant. The confidentiality of patient data stored within the drug library was at high risk, as unauthorized individuals could access and potentially misuse this sensitive information. Moreover, the integrity of the drug library data was compromised, as the vulnerability allowed unauthorized modification, leading to potential errors or incorrect medication information.

Furthermore, the availability of the device and the accuracy of the drug library were severely impacted. The device, being exposed to the Internet, faced a high risk of unauthorized access or modification by individuals with malicious intent. This situation posed a serious threat to patient safety and the proper management of medications within the healthcare system.

Considering the severity of the vulnerability and its potential impact, it is crucial to address this issue promptly to protect patient data, ensure the integrity of the drug library, and mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access and modifications.
